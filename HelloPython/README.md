# Hello Python
This lesson introduces the Python programming language using Turtle Graphics. Since this is the first meeting of the semester, it will also be important to go over ground rules and start building the classroom culture.

## Introductions
The instructors should introduce themselves and provide an overview of course expectations. Go over the course schedule and goals for the students.

## Icebreaker Activity
The main goal of the icebreaker is to make the students feel comfortable in the classroom environment. This should give them a chance to get to know each other, as well as giving the instructors a chance to get to know them.

### Ideas
- **Bluffing Game**: Each student comes up with one truth and one lie and writes them down in random order. An instructor chooses one of the options at random, and the student has 60 seconds to convince the class that it is true (after introducing themselves). The other students and the instructors can ask questions during that time period. When time is up, everybody votes. Students get a point for each correct answer.
  - Time: ~2m/student
- **Sketchpad Sharing**: Have each student open up a [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) and draw something. It can be a specific prompt, like "draw something you love" or "draw your favorite food" or anything like that. After a time, go around the room and have each student share what they drew, and introduce themselves.
  - Time: ~1.5m/student
- **Skribbl Game**: Play a game of [Skribbl](https://skribbl.io/), which is essentially online Pictionary. Create a private room, and set it to 2 rounds for 30 seconds of draw time. Use a list of custom words in order to avoid any appropriate ones. There may be a limit of 12 people for each game, so it may be necessary to break the students into breakout rooms.
  - Time: ~1.5m/student

## PowerPoint Presentation
Present the [Hello Python](HelloPython.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation.

## Code-Along Activity
The [activity](TurtleCodeAlong.md) walks through a basic turtle graphics program. The intent is not to teach any specific concept; it is designed to give the students a fun and colorful introduction to the language, and familiarize them with the syntax.

## Challenges
With any time remaining after the code-along activity, students can work on the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md).
